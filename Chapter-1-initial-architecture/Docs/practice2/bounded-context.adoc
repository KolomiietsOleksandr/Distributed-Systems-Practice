== Module name
*Passes*

== What the module is responsible for
* Customer subscription lifecycle: creation/activation, validity period storage, expiration.
* Subscription registration after a successful contract signed event.
* Obtaining a list of subscriptions.
* Marking a subscription as invalid/expired.

== What the module is NOT responsible for
* The legal part of contracts (this is the Contracts area).
* Marketing offers/discounts (this is the Offers area).
* Billing/payments (if they appear, this is a separate module).

== Data Ownership
The *Passes* module fully owns the subscription data.

Main entity: `Pass`
* `Id` — subscription identifier
* `CustomerId` — customer identifier
* `From`, `To` — validity period

The table/schema with subscriptions belongs only to this module: other modules should not directly read/write to these tables only through the module's public contract.
